### Issue #009: Add markdown support → Enhanced Editor with Markdown Support

**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Priority:** Medium
**Type:** Enhancement
**Resolution Date:** 2025-09-12

#### Original Problem
The document editor did not support markdown formatting, limiting users to plain text input without the ability to use markdown syntax for headers, bold, italic, links, lists, and other formatting.

#### Solution Implemented
Enhanced the SimpleRichTextEditor with comprehensive markdown support:

**Features Added:**
- **Markdown Mode Toggle** - Checkbox to enable/disable markdown editing mode
- **Live Preview Toggle** - Split-view editor with real-time markdown preview
- **Marked.js Integration** - Industry-standard markdown parser for reliable rendering
- **Enhanced UI Modes** - Three modes: Regular text, Markdown edit, and Split-view preview
- **Comprehensive Markdown Support** - Headers, bold, italic, links, lists, code blocks, tables, blockquotes
- **Mobile Responsive** - Split-view stacks vertically on mobile devices
- **Theme Integration** - Full compatibility with existing dark/light theme system

**Technical Implementation:**
- Installed `marked` library and TypeScript types
- Added markdown rendering with `marked.setOptions()` for GitHub-flavored markdown
- Enhanced editor layout with conditional rendering based on mode
- Added comprehensive CSS styling for markdown preview content
- Implemented mobile-responsive split-view layout

**User Experience:**
- Toggle markdown mode with checkbox in toolbar
- When enabled, toggle preview for side-by-side editing and preview
- Monospace font for markdown editing mode
- Professional typography in preview mode
- Proper syntax highlighting and formatting

#### Testing
- ✅ Markdown mode toggles correctly
- ✅ Preview mode shows live markdown rendering
- ✅ Split-view layout works on desktop
- ✅ Mobile layout stacks editor and preview vertically
- ✅ All standard markdown syntax renders correctly (headers, bold, italic, links, lists, code, tables)

### Issue #010: Untouched document marked as having unsaved edits → Document State Tracking Fix

**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Type:** Bug
**Resolution Date:** 2025-09-12

#### Original Problem
Opening and closing a document without making any changes incorrectly marked the document as having unsaved edits. This happened because the document loading process triggered change detection useEffect hooks even when no user changes were made.

#### Root Cause Identified
**Change Detection Logic Issue**: The `useEffect` hook that tracks document changes was triggered by the initial loading of document data from the API. When `setTitle()`, `setContent()`, and `setDocumentType()` were called during document loading, the change detection logic incorrectly interpreted these as user modifications.

**Problematic Code:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isLoading && (title !== 'Untitled Document' || content !== '')) {
    setHasUnsavedChanges(true)
  }
}, [title, content, documentType, isLoading])
```

#### Solution Implemented
Implemented proper change tracking by comparing current values against initially loaded values:

**Features Added:**
- **Initial Value Tracking** - Added state variables to track initially loaded document values
- **Proper Change Detection** - Modified useEffect to compare current vs initial values
- **Save State Reset** - Updated save operations to reset initial values when document is successfully saved
- **Temp Data Handling** - Properly handled temporary data restoration scenarios

**Code Changes:**
- Added `initialContent`, `initialTitle`, `initialDocumentType` state variables
- Updated change detection logic to compare against initial values
- Modified `loadDocument()` to set initial values when document loads
- Updated `saveDocument()` to reset initial values after successful save

#### Testing
- ✅ Opening existing document shows no unsaved changes initially
- ✅ Making changes correctly shows unsaved changes indicator
- ✅ Saving document resets unsaved changes state
- ✅ Temporary data restoration preserves correct change detection
- ✅ Auto-save functionality works correctly with new change detection

### Issue #001: White screen of death after latest update → Node.js Version Compatibility

**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Priority:** Critical
**Type:** Bug
**Resolution Date:** 2025-09-12

#### Original Problem
White screen on page load after latest update

#### Root Cause Identified
**Node.js Version Incompatibility**: The system was using Node.js 18.20.8 but Vite requires Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+. This caused the development server to fail with:
```
TypeError: crypto.hash is not a function
```

#### Solution Implemented
- **Upgraded Node.js**: Switched from Node.js v18.20.8 to v24.8.0 using nvm
- **Fixed JSX File Extension**: Renamed `useNotifications.ts` to `useNotifications.tsx` to support JSX syntax
- **Fixed Import Errors**: Corrected import paths from `app.core.auth` to `app.core.dependencies` 
- **Fixed Pydantic v2 Compatibility**: Updated Settings class to use `model_config` with `"extra": "ignore"`
- **Fixed SQLAlchemy Issues**: Renamed reserved `metadata` column to `usage_metadata` in models
- **Fixed Pydantic Field Validation**: Changed all `regex=` parameters to `pattern=` for Pydantic v2
- **Fixed Database Configuration**: Updated DATABASE_URL from PostgreSQL to SQLite for development

#### Resolution Details
The issue was resolved by fixing a cascade of compatibility problems:
1. Node.js version upgrade (v18 → v24)
2. TypeScript/JSX file extension fix
3. Multiple Pydantic v2 compatibility fixes
4. SQLAlchemy model corrections
5. Database connection configuration

#### Testing
- ✅ Frontend server starts without errors
- ✅ Backend server starts successfully 
- ✅ Application loads with proper UI (HTTP 200 response)
- ✅ No console errors or blank screens
- ✅ All services running on correct ports (frontend: 5175, backend: 8000)

**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Priority:** Medium
**Type:** UI/UX
**Resolution Date:** 2025-09-12

#### Original Problem

### Issue #008: Import Error - NotificationBell Component → Path Alias & Dependency Fix

**Status:** ✅ Resolved
**Priority:** Critical
**Type:** Bug
**Resolution Date:** 2025-09-12

#### Screenshot
![import error]('/home/david/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2025-09-12 13-32-33.png')

#### Original Problem
Vite import analysis failed for `"@/components/ui/button"` from `"src/components/notifications/NotificationBell.tsx"`. The error showed that the file doesn't exist, causing a blank screen on page load with React dev tools catching the error.

#### Root Cause Identified
**Two Issues Identified:**
1. **Missing Path Alias Configuration**: The `@/` path alias was not configured in Vite and TypeScript configurations
2. **Missing Dependency**: The `lucide-react` icon library was not installed but was being imported by UI components

#### Solution Implemented
Fixed both the path alias configuration and missing dependency:

**Path Alias Configuration:**
- **Vite Configuration** - Added path alias to `vite.config.ts`
- **TypeScript Configuration** - Added path mapping to `tsconfig.app.json`

**Dependency Installation:**
- **Missing Package** - Installed `lucide-react@^0.544.0` via npm
- **UI Components** - All UI components in `/src/components/ui/` now have proper icon support

#### Testing
- ✅ Frontend server starts without import errors
- ✅ Application loads successfully (HTTP 200 response)
- ✅ Path alias `@/components/ui/*` resolves correctly
- ✅ All UI components can import lucide-react icons
