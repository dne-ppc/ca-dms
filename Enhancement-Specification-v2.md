# CA-DMS Enhancement Specification v2.0

## Mission Statement

Transform the CA-DMS user experience by replacing the underutilized main dashboard with a comprehensive **Intro Page** that provides immediate value through personalized statistics, actionable insights, and quick access to pending items. This enhancement prioritizes user efficiency and system transparency over generic dashboard widgets.

### User Needs Identified
- **Quick System Overview**: Total system statistics at a glance
- **Personal Activity**: User-specific document and activity metrics
- **Actionable Items**: Outstanding approval requests and pending tasks
- **Fast Navigation**: Quick access to frequently used features
